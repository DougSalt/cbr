Java automated tools can clean out the `doc` directory, because why would you
assume people do things in a dfferent way, like not always relying on some
particular automated toolset, and crafting your own documentation? How silly
can you be? Thus be careful, your documentation may well disappear, which, as
you can imagine is somewhat annoying (this has happened to me!).
