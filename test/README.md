Start the model from the GUI and load the model in this directory.

Alternatively if you have the git repository, then go to the root of the
repository and invoke `bin/run.sh` to start the model.

Once the model is loaded just hit SetUp to test. The results of the tests will
be displayed in the Command Center window.
