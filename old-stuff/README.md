This is just somewhere to store stuff that I supsect is no longer necessary. 

+ `previous-version` - is a version of the plug-in I began writing in Scala
  using sbt. This may form the basis of a future converrsion.
+ `src` - contains classes that were parts of the original plugin
  development.This is largely the classes required for FeatureSet a generic
  implementation of NetLogo tables or hash-table.
+ `bin` - old scripts which are no longer used. This only one in there at the
  moment is how to run a testing suite from the command line using junit.
+ `lib` - contains the libraries that appeared to be required to compile the
  old versions of caber and cabernet. I am not entirely convinced that all
  these were necessary, but I have now pruned the new lib directory to only
  have the two libraries it requires.
