# PURPOSE

This is the example used by the tutorial presentation in the directory above
this.

# MANIFEST

+ README.md - this file
+ cbr - the cbr extension for NetLogo. If you upgrade then remember to copy the
  file test/cbr/cbr.jar to the directory `cbr`.
+ example.nlogo - the very simple demonstration code used in the tutorial
  presentation above this directory.
+ run.sh - for the lazy. This a command line to invoke the demonstration code.
  I write this because I get sick of search, search, search, point and click.
  To use this one you need to be in the directory above and then
  `example/run.sh`.
